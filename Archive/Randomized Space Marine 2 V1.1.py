#Created by: Disk5464
#Last Modified: 11/12/24
#Version 1.0: Inital Commit
#Version 1.1: Removed Minimal dificulty, if your using this tool your not playing on Minimal. 
#             Added weights to the difficulty so that Substantial and Ruthless are chosen slightly more often.
#             Fixed a visual bug with the quote section not properly resetting.
